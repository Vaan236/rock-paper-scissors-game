# Jack en Poy (Rock Paper Scissors Game) ✊✋✌️

This is a personal project I made to learn React! 

It's a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer. The app features animated backgrounds, emoji visuals, and score tracking.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo 📦
2. Run `npm install` 🛠️
3. Run `npm start` 🏃

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to practice React basics like components, state, and events. I also tried adding some animation and anti-spam logic for the buttons.

Made for learning and fun!
